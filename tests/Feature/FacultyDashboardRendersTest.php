/**
 * GET /faculty_dashboard must render.
 *
 * It returned HTTP 500 on main. The layout chain named two views that do not
 * exist - <x-menu.material_management /> (added only on the unmerged branch
 * main_ui_new) and @include('admin.layouts.aside') (deleted in 21682a447, whose
 * contents were folded into admin/layouts/header) - and a missing view is a fatal
 * ViewException rather than an empty region.
 *
 * BladeViewReferencesResolveTest catches the cause by scanning source; this
 * catches it the way a user would, which also covers anything the scanner cannot
 * see, such as a view name built at runtime.
 *
 * faculty/dashboard.blade.php is the only view extending faculty.layouts.master,
 * so this single route covers that whole layout.
